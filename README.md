# Movie Time Pro
In Version 2 of the Movie Time App, we enhance the functionality by integrating the `shared_preferences` plugin. This update allows users to save and retrieve their preferences and settings locally on their device. With shared preferences, users can personalize their experience, such as saving favorite movies, filtering options, and viewing preferences. This integration adds convenience and customization, making the app more user-friendly and tailored to individual needs.

## Key Feature: Shared Preferences Integration

- **Description**: The `shared_preferences` plugin provides a way to store and retrieve simple key-value pairs persistently. It is commonly used for storing user preferences, settings, and small amounts of data that need to persist across app sessions.
- **Use Case in Movie Time App**: Shared preferences are ideal for saving user settings, such as favorite movies, recently viewed movies, and user-selected filters or themes. This functionality ensures that users do not have to re-enter their preferences each time they open the app.
